Welcome to the DATA-COMMUNICATION-NETWORK-CISCO-Projects repository! This repository hosts two projects that implement various protocols and showcase network communication within an IT office environment. These projects demonstrate how devices located on different floors of an IT office communicate with each other efficiently and securely.

Projects Overview
These project focuses on implementing multiple networking protocols to facilitate communication within the IT office environment. It includes servers and devices configured to utilize protocols such as DHCP, FTP, DNS, and HTTP. Each protocol serves a specific purpose, enabling seamless communication and data exchange between devices on different floors of the office.


These projects in this repository emphasize the utilization of the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) routing protocol. OSPF is employed to ensure efficient routing of data packets within the network, optimizing network traffic and ensuring reliable communication between devices across various floors of the IT office.
Protocols Implemented

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):

DHCP is used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices within the network, simplifying network administration and management.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol):

FTP facilitates the transfer of files between networked devices, allowing users to upload, download, and manage files across the network securely.
DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites and services using human-readable domain names rather than numerical IP addresses.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

HTTP is used for transmitting and receiving hypertext messages between web clients and servers, enabling the retrieval and display of web pages and resources.
OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):

OSPF is a dynamic routing protocol used to determine the optimal paths for data packets within an IP network. It calculates routes based on the shortest path and updates routing tables dynamically to adapt to changes in network topology.
